## General Description
---
Our project is a a simulation of a casino experience. The player can choose to
play three different card games : Blackjack, Crazy Eights and Texas Hold'em.
Each game will influence the balance of a bank account that controls the user's
time limit at the casino. Furthermore, the user can choose to play other casino
games, such as the slot machine.

### Instructions
---
To play our game, the user will compile Woo.java , which will list out the games
available. The user will enter the corresponding game that they want to play
in the terminal to start that game. If they require instructions, each game will
have that option available. After playing each game, the user can check their
balance. If they have a negative balance, they will be accused of bankrupting
the casino and be kicked out. Depending on the money they have, the player
can move up tiers, and after reaching the god tier, they will go to the hall of
fame.
